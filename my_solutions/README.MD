== Install the server dependency
  - In server folder use the commands:
  ```
    npm install
    npm start
  ```
  - In cli folder use the command:
  ```
    bower start
  ```

== Starting the service
  - Use the command for start the service:
  ```
    nodejs app.js
  ```
  - After the server has started, is listen the port 595 in address **http://localhost:595**


== Using the client
  - Open the file **index.html** to use


== Using the server
  - The API using URL **http://localhost:595/api/v1/people**


== Observations
  - I'm prefering controling the packages in different folders
